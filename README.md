# HTTP/1.1 server

## 0. Introduction

This is a simple HTTP client that works on HTTP/1.1. 
Currently it only handles simple GET and POST requests.


### 0.2 Future work

First, this server will be extended to handle the full range of HTTP request methods.
I also intend to extend this server work in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
